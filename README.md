# Greetings!
In this project, the functions of encryption / decryption of text using the Vigenere cipher are performed. Encryption only supports the Russian alphabet.

There are several ways to enter text:
1. Read text from a .docx file
2. Read text from a .txt file
Below, under the information output window, there is an element for selecting the encoding, if suddenly the text in the file is not saved in UTF-8 encoding.
3. Enter manually in the text input window

The program also implements the function of saving encrypted information in .txt and .docx formats.
To check the functionality of the program, automatic testing was added to the project using the MSTest Framework.
